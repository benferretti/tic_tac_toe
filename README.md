Hello, you are on a Ruby program made by Benoit Ferretti with the help of Julien Lamalle.

Launch it with the app.rb command in your terminal.

If you are interested by the code itself, do not hesitate to read all the #.
Play a game of tic-tac-toe in your Terminal (also called Noughts and Crosses) in two player mode against your friends and family. Most players go for the middle space whenever they can, but don't ignore the corners! You can use the corners to set up multiple winning moves at once, leaving your opponent no way to block your win. Watch your opponent. Take note of where they place their symbol. Keep your eyes open for those winning spots so you can block them before they get three in a row.
