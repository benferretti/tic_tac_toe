Bonjour, vous Ãªtes sur un dossier Ruby fait par Benoit Ferretti

Play a game of tic-tac-toe in your Terminal (also called Noughts and Crosses) in two player mode against your friends and family. Most players go for the middle space whenever they can, but don't ignore the corners! You can use the corners to set up multiple winning moves at once, leaving your opponent no way to block your win. Watch your opponent. Take note of where they place their symbol. Keep your eyes open for those winning spots so you can block them before they get three in a row.
